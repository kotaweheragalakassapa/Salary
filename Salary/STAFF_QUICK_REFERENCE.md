### Common Questions

**Q: What if a student paid less?**

**Q: What if I make a mistake?**
A: Contact the admin to delete or correct the entry.

**Q: Why can't I select a class?**
A: Make sure you've selected a teacher first. Only classes assigned to that teacher will appear.

**Q: The total seems wrong!**
A: Check:
1. Did you enter the correct number of students?
2. Is the right class selected?
3. Contact admin if the per-student fee is wrong for the class.
